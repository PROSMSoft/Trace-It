# Trace It!
An action game for the 16K ZX Spectrum, where you must trace an outline whilst avoiding the baddies. Written over just four days during February 2020.

## Why is this available?
This source code has been made available for tinkerers who might like to borrow some routines for their own games. I find that some of the best adventures in coding are through reading others' code and seeing how they program - I know that I've certainly learnt a lot from other people's source code, so I hope to give back to the Spectrum community by making my own source code available to inspect.

To benefit people who may be learning how to write Z80 programs of their own, I have left all of the missed optimisations in, but I have also added comments to point out how they might be improved.

## How can I assemble this?

Just use Pasmo to assemble main.asm, and execute it from 24064.
