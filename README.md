# Trace It!
An action game for the 16K ZX Spectrum, where you must trace an outline whilst avoiding the baddies.

## Why is this available?
This source code has been made available for tinkerers who might like to borrow some routines for their own games. I find that some of the best adventures in coding are through reading others' code and seeing how they program - I know that I've certainly learnt a lot from other people's source code, so I hope to give back to the Spectrum community by making my own source code available to inspect.

## How can I assemble this?

Just use Pasmo to assemble main.asm, and execute it from 24064.
